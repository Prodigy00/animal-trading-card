			<p class="facts">In Greek, the word 'squirrel' means 'shadow tail'. The most iconic behavior of squirrels is storing nuts and acorns for winter. Which is necessary for the species of squirrel that don't hibernate. The hind legs of squirrels are double-jointed, which gives them the ability to run up and down trees very quickly.</p>

			<p>Squirrels are generally small animals, ranging in size from the African pygmy squirrel at 7–10 cm (2.8–3.9 in) in length
			and just 10 g (0.35 oz) in weight, to the Laotian giant flying squirrel at 1.08 m (3 ft 7 in) in length and the Alpine marmot,
			which weighs from 5 to 8 kg (11 to 18 lb). Squirrels typically have slender bodies with bushy tails and large eyes. In general,
			their fur is soft and silky, although much thicker in some species than others. </p>
